# Git: Push every change to GitHub

**Required:** After making ANY code changes in this project, you MUST:

1. Stage: `git add` the modified files (e.g. `git add index.html` or `git add -A`).
2. Commit: `git commit -m "Short description of change"`.
3. Push: `git push` (or rely on post-commit hook if it runs push).

Do this at the end of every response where you modified files. Do not skip pushing. The user expects every change to be on GitHub.
